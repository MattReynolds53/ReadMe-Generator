#README Generator

## Description
```
In this project, I used JavaScript, Node.js, and Inquirer to create an application that generates a professional README.md for the user.
```

## Process
```
In order to run the generator, the user must have Node.js installed. Then, the user can enter node index.js into an integrated terminal for the index.js file and begin answering the prompts. When all of the prompts are answers, the user will receive a generated README entitled sampleREADME.md in this project. 
When the user opens a preview of the sampleREADME.md, he or she can see the title, license, and subsequent sections entitled Table of Contents, Description, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions which all display the information entered into the terminal, respectively.
When the user clicks on the license badge at the top of the page, he or she will be taken to an external link describing the license.
When the user clicks on the links in the Table of Contents, he or she will be taken to that section of the sampleREADME.
