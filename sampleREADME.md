## Description
In this project, I created a README generator by utilizing JavaScript, Node.js, and Inquirer. The user will be taken through a series of prompts once they enter node index.js into the integrated terminal, and that information will be displayed in the sampleREADME file. All of the information will be displayed in the respective section of the sampleREADME, and the user can use the links in the Table of Contents to quickly navigate the page.
